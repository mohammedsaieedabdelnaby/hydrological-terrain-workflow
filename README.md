# hydrological-terrain-workflow
This repository presents an end-to-end hydrological workflow that converts
Digital Elevation Models (DEM) into catchment and stream parameters
required for HEC-HMS hydrological modeling.

The workflow includes:
- DEM preprocessing (sink filling)
- Flow direction (D8 method)
- Flow accumulation
- Stream and watershed delineation
- Hydrological post-processing
- Extraction of HEC-HMS catchment parameters
